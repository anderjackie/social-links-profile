## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I think I'm getting more confortable and more confident writing the css styles and building the structure of the page. 

This trick to center a text vertically and horizontally in the middle of a tag was pretty neat.

```css
.link-container > a {
  height: 3rem;
  line-height: 3rem; // Same value as the height
  text-align: center;
  vertical-align: middle;
}
```

### Continued development

I want to be faster so to me it will be continue to put the work
